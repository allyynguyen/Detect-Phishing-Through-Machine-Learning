# Detect-Phishing-Through-Machine-Learning

Hello! This was a previous project that I created with a group of 5 people to display at Cal Poly Pomona's annual Cybersecurity and Awareness Fair (CSAF). We created this project from September 2022-October 2022 to educate not only fellow students
within our school, but also visiting high schools that are interested in how they can detect suspicious emails or text messages. This project was primarily created in Python using the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn,
and NLTK.
